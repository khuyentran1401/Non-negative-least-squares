# Non Negative Least Squares

Non-negative least squares (NNLS) is a type of least squares problem where the coefficients are not allowed to be negative. 

# Solve NNLS with Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direct of steepest descent. Thus, the NNLS function could be minimized using Gradient Descent. 

# My approach
I used plots with max_iter and alpha as parameters to evaluate the value of the function f with a different choice of parameters
